# Improvements

this documents describes some of the potential improvements, in my opinion, that can be made in both design and functionality.

### Design

- *Seperating the Date and Search Fields*

    Although the functionality of having a hidden search bar does improve the design, some new users might experience slight confusion when using the app at first. With this sliding search functionality, it makes the user have to click extra in order to get the filter configuration that they want. While this design provides excellent ways to make the user feel more in control of the visual interface, quick usabilitiy is the tradeoff here. By seperating the form fields, it can also simplify the maintainability of the component.

- *Header Bar Sizing on Mobile*

    If we expect the user to use the filtering methods, whether by date range or text, it could be good to resize the calender/text filter bar to cover the full width of the screen in a mobile view. In this layout, the user would have better access to the input fields on screen, and would give it that classic mobile design feel.

- *Different Themes*

    I think a dark mode could look pretty cool with this design. With this, the user has a nice added control to their visual environment.

- *Link Color*

    This is a totally personal opinion, but I think the link hover color stands out too much on the b&w design. 

### Functionality

- *Seperate Email Component*

    Since the user will want to see the replies on emails, it might be good to add a seperate email component that the app can route to from the email list. This could make the component more organized when reading through long email chains. 

- *Paginator*

    Since the mail-archiver might need to display many emails, giving the option of how many emails are displayed per page could be another nice feature for the user to customize their own visual interface.
